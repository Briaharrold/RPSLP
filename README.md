Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
Made a website that can play rock paper scissors lizard spock
Peer reviewer : Jeriah Marson
peer review: 
The website layout is all there looks wise though when loading in you can see all of the pages, if you scroll on the home ready button page but once you click ready the scrolling ability disappears only the really cool design and icons other than that I would suggest you finish it cause I could really look cool if you could.
